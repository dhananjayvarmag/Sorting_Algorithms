# Using Efficient Sorting Algorithms in Java to Arrange Tax Data.

In this course (offered by Coursera), I have learnt how to create an application that sorts a dataset of tax information.I also learnt how to analyze a sorting algorithm's efficiency, and then how to implement each algorithm in Java using easy-to-understand concepts.

I have observed the time taken by different sorting algorithms by running a program, which calculates the time taken by different sorting algorithms.The results are as below,

Bubble Sort took    : 0.067 seconds  
Insertion Sort took : 0.041 seconds  
Selection Sort took : 0.053 seconds  
Merge Sort took     : 0.046 seconds  
Quick Sort took     : 0.005 seconds
