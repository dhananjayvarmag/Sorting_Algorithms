# Using Efficient Sorting Algorithms in Java to Arrange Tax Data.

In this course (offered by Coursera), I have learnt how to create an application that sorts a dataset of tax information.I also learnt how to analyze a sorting algorithm's efficiency, and then how to implement each algorithm in Java using easy-to-understand concepts.

I have observed the time taken by different sorting algorithms by running a program, which calculates the time taken by different sorting algorithms.The results are as below,

Welcome to the Sorting Tester  
This program demonstrates different sorting methods and their effciencies using Missouri County Sales Tax Data    

Bubble Sort took &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    : 0.067 seconds&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time Complexity:O(n^2)  
Insertion Sort took &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: 0.041 seconds&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time Complexity:O(n^2)  
Selection Sort took &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: 0.053 seconds&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time Complexity:O(n^2)  
Merge Sort took &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;: 0.046 seconds&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time Complexity:O(n*logn)  
Quick Sort took  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   : 0.005 seconds&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Average Time Complexity:O(n^2)
